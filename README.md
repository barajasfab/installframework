REMINDER - It is always best practice to produce a backup of your website and database prior to implementing any change to ensure it can be undone. If you choose to use this script, you are doing so at your own risk and take full responsibility.

This is for use on a Linux server running CentOS 5.x & 6.x. Just log into your server via SSH and run the script.

This script is still in active development. If you find any bugs, please email the issue to bugreport@trekmode.com
